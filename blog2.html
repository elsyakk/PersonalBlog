                Astronomy has always been a deep hobby of mine to go down the rabbithole <br>
                to. I wanted to take Aerospace Engineering on 11th grade because of my <br>
                adoration of the Space Rockets, as I never missed most of SpaceX or NASA <br>
                livestream. <br>
                <br>
                There’s really something that is very peculiar about the space. Staring at the <br>
                dark night out there make me wanders and fills me with curiosity to know <br>
                what’s out there and what are the secrets that the universe hold for us to <br>
                uncover, and the rest that we will never discover. <br>

                I fall in love with Perseverance and Curiosity Rover. As they are on the quest <br>
                on a lonely planet, vastly far away from our home, the earth. It drives me in <br>
                awe into how lonely we are out there while we knew that the possibilities of <br>
                us being alone in the universe and not being alone both are scary. <br>
                <br>
                I used to want to become an Astro-Physicsts who is dedicating her life for <br>
                science and having the life to uncover the quest of the Universe. There’s so <br>
                much things to discover and I always wanted to know more about the world <br>
                that we live in and anything bigger than us. <br>
                <br>
                To see all of the accomplishments that the human-kind has made throughout <br>
                the scientific journey drives me into feeling a sort of goosebumps as I know <br>
                that there are much more to uncover. That scary, unfamiliar part of the <br>
                Universe and to the smallest scale of it, smaller than atoms, which is the <br>
                absurdity of quantum. <br>
                <br>
                I love reading of all of the theories about the Universes such as the Parallel <br>
                Worlds, the String Theories, the Big Bang Theories and the mysteries that <br>
                surround them as I still could not grasp that there was, or was not anything at <br>
                all, that we call “nothing” before all of it. <br>
                <br>
                It is really intriguing to come up and realise on how insignificant all of us  <br>
                are, not even as small as a sand, but we are near nothing. We are just <br>
                universe that is aware of ourselves, as we call it consciousness, while each of <br>
                us trying to find our own meaning of the world. <br>
                <br>
                All of the things that are significant to us to a great amount is nothing, really <br>
                nothing, compared to everything the Universe held. It’s a reminder that our <br>
                part of being conscious as human being is truly a gift and wonders for us to <br>
                delve more and explore; as we are still an insignificant being that lost in an <br>
                infinite (or not) space. <br>
