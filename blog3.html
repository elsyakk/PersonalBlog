                One of the favorite lies I have ever told is that if I wanted to do or experience <br>
                something, i can find a way for me to do that in the future. but the <br>
                problem is, life is not forever <br>
                <br>
                we are running out of time. in a place full of questions and despair, everyone <br>
                seems to live day by day, not finding meaning through it all. we all distract <br>
                ourselves from the dissatisfaction of life into the consumerism culture that <br>
                brings us happiness, temporarily, before getting back into the loop. <br>
                <br>
                it is easy to become distracted at such things, there are too many <br>
                entertainments and external influences that stopped us from thinking individually, <br>
                what do we want out of this life? <br>
                <br>
                is it this hustle towards more only to never become satisfied, or are we <br>
                too scared to try out the outcast path? remind me again, what are we scared <br>
                of? is it the path of being disliked by the mass, which yields to unhappiness <br>
                and a prolonged people pleaser. <br>
                <br>
                we all tend to highlight the community culture amongst us, the usual "us <br>
                humans are social creature", but have you ever tried to do the opposite of <br>
                that? from what i've observed, people are too fixated on the "social" part to <br>
                the point that choosing path differently-being an outcast-is seen as a <br>
                strange, unfamiliar thing that must be condemned. is that what we want in <br>
                society? <br>
                <br>
                to live is to experience many things, positive or negative, and the life that i <br>
                want is on the opposite side of fear. when i found a new thing to get scared <br>
                of, go for it, facing fears is good for the souls. we have nothing to get scared <br>
                anyways, and nothing to lose either. <br>
                <br>
                so, when you are faced with options or opportunities that scare you, it's a <br>
                sign of a good change, it's a sign of moving a step forward in life. it's the <br>
                beauty of life, we all have nothing to lose, anyways. all of our materialistic wants or <br>
                perception of ourselves are all fake, it's an illusions <br>
                <br>
                we deserve to be happy and to seek a better life, so go out there, find it, <br>
                and face your fears. mental fears are fake, anyways <br>
