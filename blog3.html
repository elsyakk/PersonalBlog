            <p class="section__text__p1">
                one time when I was browsing through countless books on goodreads, I <br>
                came across a book by Bill Gates written, “The road ahead” with a long road <br>
                as the cover of the book. it was electric for me, there is just something about <br>
                that title and book cover that brings me into the core of my endeavors. the <br>
                road, ahead of me. <br>
                <br>
                what came across from that book is that the end of the road is not visible <br>
                from where the photo was taken. the road looks never ends. it struck into <br>
                me, I feel like a lot of the human ambitions are just a long road, achieving <br>
                one or another, or even encountering setbacks on the road. we cannot <br>
                predict what’s out there. we can only focus on the present, whether we are <br>
                capable enough to pass the road, no matter how bumpy, or how long it takes <br>
                to the perceived end goal. <br>
                <br>
                the name end goal is not necessarily true, there is no end goal to the human <br>
                imagination and dream, we are truly a greedy souls. <br>
                <br>
                to me, the meaning of “The Road Ahead” is the limitless of the human <br>
                accomplishment, even each of us. it is a way to see life differently, beyond the <br> 
                pointless 9-to-5 job that most people ended up with. it is a representation of <br>
                a long journey and the limitless dream that we can have <br>
                <br>
                dream is only a dream, until we face it, and make it into our lives. isn’t life <br>
                beautiful? remember that all of our setbacks, and failures, they don’t <br>
                matter. all the embarrassing moment, they do not matter at all. <br>
                <br>
                in the end, we will be forgotten and humanity will die. that bring me into a <br>
                state of calmness and an acceptance of the life that I live in. there is no <br>
                point in life, that is why each of us make our own point, and being content and <br>
                satisfaction, is the end goal. <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                have a great road, ahead <br>
